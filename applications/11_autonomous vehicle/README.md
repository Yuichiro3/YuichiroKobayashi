# Purpose:
## - Learning how to use Iterative Deepening Search and Depth Limited Search
## - The problem is autonomous vehicle navigation

# Note:
## - My algorithm is redundant since searching time is massive.
## - In the near future, it should be modified based on the model answer.
## - And also, the number of steps and the final path from start to goal should be visualised for clarity.

Write a program that provides a suitable menu system for your conversion functions. This program should import the module and access the functions (functions should not be defined in the same file as the user interface). You will need to carefully consider how the user enters information and the upper and lower bounds (valid range) for each type of conversion. For example, the temperature cannot go below 0o Kelvin."],"metadata":{"id":"OafuWDezX4Nr"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"YEBCYxstL2kN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730693817931,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Yuichiro Kobayashi","userId":"02684221739269850722"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Length Conversion: Feet and inches to meters\n","def feet_inches_to_meters(feet, inches):\n","    total_inches = feet * 12 + inches\n","    meters = total_inches * 0.0254\n","    return meters"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Length Conversion: Pounds to kilograms\n","def pounds_to_kilograms(pounds):\n","    return pounds * 0.453592"],"metadata":{"id":"Bvd05-HKX4Fq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730693878383,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":364,"user":{"displayName":"Yuichiro Kobayashi","userId":"02684221739269850722"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Temperature Convversion: Kelvin to Celsius\n","def kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin):\n","    if kelvin < 0:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Temperature cannot be below 0 Kelvin\")\n","    return kelvin - 273.15"],"metadata":{"id":"MRVqYdTbYYjO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730693916407,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":252,"user":{"displayName":"Yuichiro Kobayashi","userId":"02684221739269850722"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Time Conversion: Hours and minutes to seconds\n","def hours_minutes_to_seconds(hours, minutes):\n","    return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60"],"metadata":{"id":"JQs-TPnhYYli","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730693917704,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":326,"user":{"displayName":"Yuichiro Kobayashi","userId":"02684221739269850722"}}},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# EOF"],"metadata":{"id":"p1YtJgyrYWIR"}}]}

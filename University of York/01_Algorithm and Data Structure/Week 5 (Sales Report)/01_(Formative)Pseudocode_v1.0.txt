1. Assumption 
My three choices 1, 4 and 5. In order to execute three tasks, the document provides five algorithms in pseudocode. In addition, pseudocode conventions [1] are used for each algorithm.


2. Tasks
2.1. QuarterlySalesForEachDepartment (1)
The total sales for each department per quarter i.e. “2nd Quarter totals: Electrical, £208,000”
[Pseudocode1] SetArray
Input: Sales data for each department from April to September
Output: Array for sales of each department


1     DECLARE Electrical(6) of integers
2     Electrical = {67, 63, 78, 78, 104, 103}
3     DECLARE Kitchen(6) of integers 
4     Kitchen = {65, 67, 56, 45, 56, 72}
5     DECLARE Bathroom(6) of integers 
6     Bathroom = {63, 63, 65, 71, 73, 69}
7     DECLARE SoftFurnishing(6) of integers
8     SoftFurnishing = {18, 24, 22, 19, 17, 16}
9     DECLARE Accessories(6) of integers
10   Accessories = {16, 23, 21, 19, 20, 19}
[Pseudocode2] QuarterlySalesForEachDepartment
Input: Array for sales of each department
Output: Quarterly sales for each department


// The programme for summation from April to June 
1     Q2Start = 1  // Index for April
2     Q2End = 3   // Index for June
3     for i = Q2Start, i ≦ Q2End , i++   //  Summation for each department from April to June
4          ElectricalSalesQ2 += Electrical[i] 
5          KitchenSalesQ2 += Kitchen[i]
6          BathroomSalesQ2 += Bathroom[i]
7          SoftFurnishingSalesQ2 += SoftFurnishing[i]
8          AccessoriesSalesQ2 += Accessories[i]
// The programme for summation from July to September 
9     Q3Start = 4 // Index for July
10   Q3End = 6 //  Index for September
11   for i = Q3Start, i ≦ Q3End , i++  //  Summation for each department from July to September
12        ElectricalSalesQ3 += Electrical[i] 
13        KitchenSalesQ3 += Kitchen[i]
14        BathroomSalesQ3 += Bathroom[i]
15        SoftFurnishingSalesQ3 += SoftFurnishing[i]
16        AccessoriesSalesQ3 += Accessories[i]
2.2. TaxForEachQuarter (4)
Given the total sales for each quarter, calculate the tax that needs to be paid at 17%.
[Pseudocode3] QuartelySalesForEachQuarter
Input: Quarterly sales for each department
Output: Quarterly sales for each quarter


1     SalesQ2 = ElectricalSalesQ2 + KitchenSalesQ2 + BathroomSalesQ2 +SoftFurnishingSalesQ2 + AccessoriesSalesQ2
2     return SalesQ2
3     SalesQ3 = ElectricalSalesQ3 +  KitchenSalesQ3 +  BathroomSalesQ3 + SoftFurnishingSalesQ3 + AccessoriesSalesQ3
4     return SalesQ3
[Pseudocode4] QuarterlyTax
 Input: Quarterly sales and tax rate.
Output: Quarterly tax


1     TaxRate = 0.17     
2     TaxQ2 = SalesQ2 * TaxRate
3     return TaxQ2
4     TaxQ3 = SalesQ3 * TaxRate
5     return TaxQ3
2.3. NewSalesTarget (5)
[Pseudocode5] NewSalesTarget
Input: Sales for each department in Q3 and target rate
Output: Sales target for each department


1     TargetRate = 0.12
2     ElectricalNewTarget = ElectricalSalesQ3 * (1 +TargetRate)
3     return ElectricalNewTarget
4     KitchenNewTarget = KitchenSalesQ3 * (1 + TargetRate)
5     return KitchenNewTarget
5     BathroomNewTarget = BathroomSalesQ3 * (1 + TargetRate)
6     return BathroomNewTarget
7     SoftFurnishingNewTarget = SoftFurnishingSalesQ3 * (1 + TargetRate)
8     return SoftFurnishingNewTarget
9     AccessoriesNewTarget = AccessoriesSalesQ3 * (1 + TargetRate)
10   return AccessoriesNewTarget
